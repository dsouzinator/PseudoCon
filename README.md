# PseudoCon
## Abstract  
Recent advances in Semi-supervised learning(SSL) have made enormous strides in performance by leveraging unlabeled data. They are fast approaching state of the art performance on standard image classification benchmarks set by their purely supervised learning counterparts. We introduce PseudoCOn in this paper, an algorithm that builds on 'FixMatch' and 'SupCON', recent works in semi-supervised and supervised contrastive learning respectively. The model consists of a predictive head and an encoder head. It first predicts a pseudo label on a weakly augmented image. This label is then used as a ground truth to train a strongly augmented version of the same image. At the same time this pseudo label is used to train the encoder head via a supervised contrastive loss function.
